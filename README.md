This is an application currently in production, set to launch in October 2017. Mamas Connect is a networking app for mothers living in Portland who are looking for advice, local playdates, and a genuine way to connect with other mothers living in their area. The app will feature messaging, a blog, and a calendar of local events, and will give users a way to favorite events and blog posts.
